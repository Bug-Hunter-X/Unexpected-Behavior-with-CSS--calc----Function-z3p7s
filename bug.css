The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results when used with percentages and other units if the calculation order is not carefully considered.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not behave as expected if the containing element's width is not yet defined when the calculation occurs. This can lead to unexpected layout shifts or rendering errors.  Another less common issue is incorrect usage of the `/* */` comment syntax within `calc()`, which can lead to parsing errors.  For example, using a comment within the calculation itself, like `calc(100px /* comment */ + 20px)`, is invalid and might cause unexpected behavior.
